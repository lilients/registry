## About

ImpactViz - Open Impact Visualiser enables the display of open metrics on article pages

ImpactViz aims to visualize the impact of publications. Based on an pesistent identifier (e.g. DOI) scientometric information for a publication will be harvested and visualized. All data is being retrieved from open data sources, that supply an open interface.

### Context and Contact

This tool is an outcome of the project ["Reference implementation for Scientometric Information" (ROSI)](http://tib.eu/rosi-project) funded by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/) (BMBF). The project is carried out at the [Open Science Lab](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science/) of the [Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology](http://tib.eu/) (TIB). [More information about the project](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/project-overview/project-summary/rosi/)

If you would like to give feedback on this tool, please contact us via email: [rosi.project(at)tib.eu](mailto:rosi.project(at)tib.eu). You can find the code this website is based on at [GitHub](https://github.com/TIBHannover/impactViz).

### Concepts

In ImpactViz scientometric indicators are categorized in four concepts that have been developed within the ROSI project: Scientific impact, societal impact, community impact, and openness.

* Scientific Impact: The impact that a work has within the scientific community. The scientific impact is mostly based on citation-based indicators (e.g. publication impact as measured through citations.
* Societal Impact: The impact that a work has within society - like recognition from societal groups or for societal activities. Measurable impact can be retrieved e.g via patents, citations in policy documents and mentions in (social) media.
* Community Impact: Involvement in the scientific community. Examples are participation in conferences, peer review and editorial activities.
* Openness: Compliance to Open Science Standards like FAIR research data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable und Reusable). Social openness (e.g. readability) can also be concidered.

All indicators that are available - and the concept they are attached to - can be viewed further down this page.

### Customization

ImpactViz allows a selection of the displayed indicators. You can select between one of the [existing customizations](https://labs.tib.eu/rosi/prototype/customize/) or create a new one. This feature is still a work on progress. Currently not all indidcators can be selected.


## Indicators

This is the list of available indicators. Depending on the selected [customization](https://labs.tib.eu/rosi/prototype/customize/) not all of the indicators my be displayed.
