## About

The ROSI prototype aims to visualize the impact of publications and other entities. Based on an pesistent identifier (e.g. DOI) scientometric information for an entity will be harvested and visualized. All data is being retrieved from open data sources, that supply an open interface.

### Context and Contact

This prototype is a outcome of the project ["Reference implementation for Scientometric Information" (ROSI)](http://tib.eu/rosi-project) funded by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/) (BMBF). The project is carried out at the [Open Science Lab](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science/) of the [Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology](http://tib.eu/) (TIB).

### Concepts

Scientometric indicators are categorized in four concepts that have been developed within the ROSI project: Scientific impact, societal impact, community, and openness.

* Scientic Impact: The impact that an entity has within the scientific community; is mostly based on citation-based indicators (e.g. publication impact as measured through citations or the number of publications (adopted from Neylon 2017).
* Societal Impact: The impact that an entity has within society. Recognition from societal groups or for societal activities; measurable impact (e.g via patents, citations in policy documents, mentions in social media, press).
* Community: Involvement in the scientific community (e.g. participation in conferences, peer review and editorial activities, and learned societies).
* Openness: Compliance to Open Science Standards (e.g. FAIR research data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable und Reusable), social openness (readability etc.).

### Customization

The ROSI prototype allows a selection of the displayed indicators. You can select between one of the [existing customizations](https://labs.tib.eu/rosi/prototype/customize/) or create a new one. This feature is still a work on progress. Currently not all indidcators can be selected.


## Indicators

This is the list of available indicators. Depending on the selected [customization](https://labs.tib.eu/rosi/prototype/customize/) not all of the indicators my be displayed.
